This project entails setting up a system that initiates with the installation of required applications, ensuring avoidance of repeated installations. It performs an anonymity check of the network connection, alerting if non-anonymous, and revealing the spoofed country name if anonymous. It also accepts user-specified scan targets. Furthermore, the system can establish a remote SSH connection to retrieve server details and execute commands such as Whois and open port scans. Finally, it saves the gathered data into local files and maintains a log for auditing data collection activities.
